# Plug and Play ADMM
This repository provides a simple Pytorch implementation of plug and play ADMM with examples.

The notebook `pnp_admm_example.ipynb` contains a example in which a pretrained convnet gaussian denoiser is downloaded (120MB) and plugged into ADMM for solving a motion deblur, inpainting, and super-resolution problem. You can also [view in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XHGdKA-eTvOUwto2jA89z1SEfLTdR-jN?usp=sharing).

The notebook `denoiser_training.ipynb` contains code for training a denoiser from scratch using a subset of ImageNet as trainingset. The trainingset will be download automatically (250MB). You can also [view in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1E_xJS6xwKSlSBR7mEjpwMe5WjefpzQ43?usp=sharing).
